# Avenue App
  
### Social Media for music events.

Find events near you, check in, share images and comments **only** with attendees of the event.

Re-live past events through a timeline of comments and photos.

Written in Swift and maintained to Swift 3.0. Development paused due to similar functionality to Facebook Events App.
